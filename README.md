## Features

- **RFID Control**: Players capture a point by tapping an RFID wristband or card. The device beeps to indicate a team change, and the timer continues for the active team.

- **Multi-Team Support**: Standard setup for 2 teams, expandable up to 4 teams.  
- **Modular Design**: Components can be replaced without soldering.  
- **Open-Source Hardware**: Built on Arduino, making components affordable and replaceable.  
- **Display**: LCD2004A (I2C) for clear point and team information.
